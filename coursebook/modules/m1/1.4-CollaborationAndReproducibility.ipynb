    "## Git Flow and Pull Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "When setting up a new project, and especially when you are working collaboratively, you might want to consider following a branching model such as Git Flow, where different branches have specific roles and it is clearly defined when and how they should interact. This will facilitate collaboration, testing and code reviews. Note that this is not the only type of workflow and [GitHub workflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) is another established option.\n",

    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Branches\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Git Flow two branches will record the entire history of the project and have an infinite lifetime:\n",
    "- **Main**: which contains the release history\n",
    "- **Develop**: which is the integration branch for features.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a new project we suggest to create the Develop branch (Main will be there from the beginning) and to change the default branch to Develop.\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Branch\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time a new feature is planned or a bug / problem needs to be addressed we suggest to first document it in a specific issue, which specifies the problem and the type of expected outcome. Remember that it is very important that issues are focused on a specific and contained task and clearly described. \n",
    "\n",
    "![GitFlow](../../figures/m1/branch_names.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "\n",
    "If a collaborator would like to address this, they should open a dedicated feature branch (from Develop). On GitHub each issue is identified with a number and it is important to be consistent with naming conventions of branches to keep a consistent overview. For instance see the following example.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few important things for a person addressing an issue:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take your time to study the code and design an idea for addressing the problem, before starting the implementation\n",
    "2. Some issues may request several steps. You should address each step in a different commit in your branch (with a clear descriptive comment). This is useful so that you can later point to a specific commit during the code review process\n",
    "3. When you feel you are in a good stage and would like to receive feedback, you can open a pull request (even in draft mode, to signal that is still a work in progress)\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pull Requests\n",
    "\n",
    "A Pull Request (PR) allows the possibility of merging the code back to the Develop branch. You can open it from the GitHub web interface as in the example below. Once a pull request is opened by a collaborator, you can discuss and review the potential changes with them and they can add follow-up commits if necessary before the changes are merged into Develop.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Pull Request example](../../figures/m1/pr_example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some important points for the person addressing an issue and opening the PR:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Remember that your work doesn't need to be completely finished (especially for complex PRs), but you might have an initial workflow for a solution and now it's the time that someone else could look at your code.\n",
    "2. Introduce your PR with a clear description, pointing to the issue this PR would close, the main component of your solution, the tests you have done, etc.\n",
    "3. Try to put yourself in the reviewer's shoes: the solution you would like to review should be simple (not clever!), not too long and especially comprehensible. For instance, if you have added new code, spend time renaming variables so that they are consistent with the overall style.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some important points for the person reviewing the PR:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First of all, remember to be nice and polite with your collaborator, it is stressful for anyone to have their code reviewed.\n",
    "2. Read the issue the PR is planning to address\n",
    "3. Go through the proposed solution, you will be able to see an overview of all modifications from the `Files changed` tab\n",
    "4. When you have understood the proposed solution, checkout the branch of the PR and test the code\n",
    "5. Ask questions if something is not clear. You can do this by adding the comment exactly at the line in the code you are referring to, from the `Files changed` tab. You could either add this as a single comment or `Start a review`. Start a review will hold all your comments, until you have finished your review and then show these to the Collaborator together with the overall feedback.\n",
    "![Add specific comments](../../figures/m1/pr_add_comments.png)\n",
    "6. Both the reviewer and the contributor will be able to point to specific commits by writing its SHA-hash, and it'll automatically get turned into a link (see the example below). \n",
    "![Reference to a specific commit](../../figures/m1/pr_commit_id.png)\n",
    "7. When you are satisfied with a change or a reply of a comment you can resolve it, so you will keep open only comments that still need to be resolved.\n",
    "8. When you have finished you can add an overall feedback and your decision. Unless there are clear bugs that need a `Request changes`, most of the time a general `Comment` will give your collaborator the chance to discuss and address the feedback in conversation with you.\n",
    "9. When all things have been addressed, if you are satisfied with the PR you can proceed by merging it and closing the dedicated branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other types of branches\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from dedicated feature branches and the long-running Develop and Main branch, there are other important branches in the Git Flow model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Release**: Once you are approaching a point when you would like to do a first public release of your code (for instance, when you are submitting a paper and you want to accompany it with the code to reproduce the experiments), you can create a dedicated release branch. Creating this branch starts a \"release cycle\", so no new features can be added after this point, only bug fixes, documentation generation, and other release-oriented tasks should go in this branch. Once it's ready, the release branch gets merged into main and tagged with a version number. In addition, it should be merged back into develop, which may have progressed since the release was initiated. Using a specific, dedicated branch to prepare releases makes it possible to polish the current release while others continue working on features for a future release. It also creates well-defined phases of development.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hotfix**: Maintenance or “hotfix” branches are used to quickly fix issues directly in the main branch. They are very similar to release branches and feature branches except they're based on main instead of develop. As soon as the fix is complete, it should be merged into both main and develop, and main should be tagged with an updated version number. \n",

    "\n",
    "However, building and testing your code requires a server. You can of course build and test updates locally before pushing code to a repository, but to be sure that your implementation works on different systems you can use a CI server that checks for new code commits in a repository. Since the end of 2018, GitHub has been offering what they call \"GitHub actions\", which are specific workflows that will be ran automatically on certain events (for instance at each commit or before merging a PR into Develop). It is important to understand that GitHub with these workflows (which are composed by multiple \"jobs\", such as building the code and then running a series of tests) is not providing you with the equivalent of a Virtual Machine where you can run your experiments. Instead, these actions are specific checks that your code works as expected, based on a series of predefined tests.
