    "  - The dilemma of whether to first develop a research question and then find a dataset, or first select a known dataset and then develop the question is well-known. The default way to do science is the former, but at the same time data science as a field is driven by the availability in digital format of an unprecedented new amount of data. Therefore in reality it is common to follow a hybrid approach: Define a broad research question or select a wider area of research, then select datasets that provide rich information for this area and finally examine the datasets to understand how to best refine your question in order to be impactful, interesting but also answerable. The opposite approach of first choosing a dataset and then try to find research questions that arise from looking at it is usually not advisable as it often leads to biased hypotheses. It might also run counter to the ideas of data minimisation, i.e. collecting personal data only for defined purposes, rather than just to store them and decide how to use them later. \n",
    "  - Refining the research question should lead to a better understanding of what data are needed to solve the problem and if existing data sources adequately represent variables that have been identified as important. There are cases where the question cannot be answered with available data. This might lead to further work and discussion in order to refine the research question given the constraints of the data we have available. Or it might lead to a decision to collect new data (which could become a different research project altogether).\n",
    "- When a dataset has been selected, it is always essential to assess the copyright, data sharing agreement, sensitivity of the information contained and data collection policy of the selected resource.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Data extraction and procurement:\n",
    "  - Data not easily accessible (e.g. due to sensitivity): In fields like healthcare or finance, it is often the case that individual-level data have barriers to access. There are typically complex governance processes to gain access and even then access might be granted only within secure environments (e.g. a Data Safe Haven). It is recommended to apply for access early in the project or even long before the project starts in these cases. It might also be appropriate to explore other options like anonymised or synthetic versions of the sensitive data.\n",
    "  - No documentation: This is a typical issue with many datasets that have been created without propoerly documenting the contents. It is advisable to come in touch with data curators/owners but also with domain experts that might be able to shed light in those cases.\n",
    "  - Data quality is low: This is the case where there are a lot of missing or erroneous data due to issues in data generation or collection. These might be related to the physical process that generates the data. There are various options to deal with this problem. In some cases, we might be able to use data science methods that handle missingness, etc (see Module 2). In other cases, domain experts might help clean the data by working with the data scientists. It is also an option to avoid using a data source if we think it is too problematic or even drop the project entirely.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Modeling and reporting:\n",
    "  - Black boxes: A common issue is when a data science product is built without any care for explainability and reporting. This is the case of an algorithm that just produces predictions but without providing any information on how these are produced, what factors are considered, how performance changes over time and how individual users are affected. It is important to agree ways to achieve those things in the scoping stage and to consider these challenges if we plan to reproduce the results of a tool presented by other researchers.\n",
    "  - No baseline: If we do not set a baseline, we might not be able to tell if our models work well or not. It is always disappointing to spend months of work on a sophisticated model only to realise that a naive predictor does an equally good job. Automated ML tools (see [auto-sklearn](https://github.com/automl/auto-sklearn) and [TPOT](http://epistasislab.github.io/tpot/)) can help in this case, as they are capable of generating a lot of baseline models and do some basic data science work (e.g. feature engineering) without much user effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deployment:\n",
    "  - Initial deployment is tricky: A lot of issues typically pop-up in eaarly deployment. It is also the critical period for user adoption if users exist. Data scientists should be prepared for iterative improvements and communicate expectations clearly to the users before this stage. The timing of the deployment is important; avoid overlaps with busy periods for users (e.g. cases where a business team needs to deliver another big project while testing the deployed product).\n",
    "  -  Maintenance responsibility: Maintenance of a piece of software is a usually under-estimaated part of the project lifecycle. A lot of open source software depends on support from volunteers which might not be sustainable. Research Engineering teams typically deliver products but then their time in the project expires. This might lead to lack of maintenance. It is advisable to try to engage researchers and other stakeholders in the software development process so that they have the knowledge to maintain the project once developer time expires. \n",
