This practice now finds its way through the algorithm to the present; the algorithm predicts higher crime in those neighbourhoods and police presence is increased; but increased police presence leads to more crime being detected and reported, creating a feedback loop that perpetuates the same practices. \n", "- **Surveillance**: There is a flip side to the coin of biased facial recongition software mentioned above.
