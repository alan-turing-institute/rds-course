    "> Dear Research Engineering Group,\n",
    "I am reaching out for scoping a potential collaboration. Social inequalities in health have been described across a range of European countries. While it is well-known in the literature that the higher the social class, the lower the prevalence and/or incidence of health problems, no study has attempted to explain social inequalities in health for Europe as a whole. To address this, I am setting up a project proposal for a large-scale study using new available data (European Quality of Life Time Series, freely available [online](https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/87445)) and machine learning techniques. I envision a a 2-year project answering the call “Personal Stories, Healing Nations” employing 1 full-time Post-Doctoral researcher at University of Eastfolk covering the social science parts of the study and (potentially) in collaboration with your team for the technological parts. We are hoping to submit by Dec 1st, so we would be keen to establish the costs for this digital component by Nov 28. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> While I am fairly new to big-data (and, I have to admit, I have my reservations), but I believe a well-designed project with these sources might be able to rewrite our understanding of social inequalities in health in Europe (and even beyond) and its impact will be relevant for the general public and could potentially even suggest actions to governments.\n",

    "\n",
    "They want to explain social inequalities in health for Europe as a whole through the use of a \"new\" dataset and \"machine learning\".\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This is absolutely not clear from the initial email, you need to discuss it with the PI during the meeting (knowing the dataset is essential here). The PI should direct people towards the definition of a task focused on: \n",
    "- predicting a specific variable (the self reported health)\n",
    "- binarize the variable, to make the analysis simpler (The variable was dichotomised as “good” health (good and fair) versus “poor” health\n",
    "- use other variables as features\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Is data available?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The PI refers to \"European Quality of Life Survey\", linking to a Cornell library website. However, by googling more, the dataset pointed is the most recent version of a series of datasets created by [this project](https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/european-quality-of-life-surveys). Data for 2007 and 2011 is available in open access (CC 4.0) [here](https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=7724#!/access-data), for the most recent version you would need to register to [UKDS](https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/surveys/about-eurofound-surveys/data-availability). There are publications referring to the dataset, are there available libraries?\n",

    "**4. What are the stakeholders' expectations?**\n",
    "\n",
    "From the initial email they are at the same time very vague and problematic. There is both a bit of skepticism around \"big-data\" methods and the desire of doing something ground-breaking. Participants should try to define more clearly what the PI really would like to achieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. How does the output product look like and how is it going to be used?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The discussion with the PI should reach the point where a MVP is agreed in the form of an initial study in which the use of some variables are examined to predict self reported health. We could start by for instance focusing only on a single country. Methodologically the PI is not looking improving over the state-of-the-art, they want something reliable and reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. What is the state of the art (either in literature or within the organisation)? Is the goal of this project to go beyond this? Is there any documentation of legacy systems?**\n",

    "No literature review provided on methods. They should either find the paper we used as inspiration or we can provide it to them. \n",

    "\n",
    "Out of scope: studies beyond Europe, engaging with the public. No more datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. What is the expected impact?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Is this really expected \"could potentially even suggest actions to governments\"? Does the PI have previous experience with engaging with potical actors? No, the PI was being overly optimistic, the expected impact is a wide analysis of the dataset to get a better understanding of the phenomenon in the academic environment, not beyond. The grant will not include activities (workshops etc) for engaging with the public or government.\n",

    "**9. What metrics do we use to measure the success of the project?**\n",

However, there are a lot of variables missing in Wave 2. So it would be better to stick with Wave 3. This will be discussed further in Module 2, but good if someone already spots it and also if they notice differences between countries.\n",
