    "Once you’ve found a dataset for your research question there are many formats it could be in - tabular data, databases, documents,\n",
    "images or many more. In this section we give an overview of common data\n",
    "types and how they can be loaded into Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several of the file/data formats here are also covered in our [Research\n",
    "Software Engineering\n",
    "course](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/rsd-engineeringcourse/).\n",

    "    \"French\",\"Mr F\",\"Friday\",1000,1300\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line (usually) specifies the table column names, with each\n",
    "name separated by a comma. The subsequent lines specify the values of\n",
    "those columns for each row in our data, with each column value separated\n",
    "by a comma.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we will use a dataset downloaded from The World Bank,\n",
    "giving the percentage of people living in urban environments by country\n",
    "worldwide since 1960. You can find the original source data\n",
    "[here](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.URB.TOTL.IN.ZS?view=chart).\n",

    "\n",
    "We can think of databases as containers for data. Typically, databases\n",
    "allow for easy storage, retrieval, update, and analysis of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of tabular data, a database may have many tables. A database\n",
    "can be flat, or it can be relational.\n",

    "Flat databases can be simple but also inefficient. Relational databases,\n",
    "with data stored in a series of interconnected tables, can be more\n",
    "complicated but more computationally efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL Databases & RDBMS\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured Query Lanage (SQL) is a standard language for storing,\n",
    "manipulating and retrieving data in databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "An RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) is the basis for SQL\n",
    "and relies on the [relational data\n",
    "model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_model). Many modern and\n",
    "popular databases implement the ideas of an RDBMS. Some common\n",
    "implementations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   PostgreSQL\n",
    "-   SQLite\n",
    "-   MySQL\n",
    "-   Oracle\n",
    "-   MS Access\n",
    "\n",
    "We use SQL to interact with these databases. You can find some basic,\n",
    "interactive, tutorials at [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### NoSQL Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "> NoSQL databases (aka \"not only SQL\") are non tabular, and store data\n",
    "> differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety\n",
    "> of types based on their data model. The main types are document,\n",
    "> key-value, wide-column, and graph. They provide flexible schemas and\n",
    "> scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.\n",
    "> *https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained*\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common NoSQL Databases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Elasticsearch (document)\n",
    "-   MongoDB (document)\n",
    "-   DynamoDB (key-value)\n",
    "-   Gaffer (graph)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Document example**\n",

    "Unfortunately, different types of databases will often have their own,\n",
    "unique, query languages, beyond SQL - more to learn!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where Is the Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Databases can exist on your local machine or can be hosted elsewhere.\n",
    "Typically, we’ll want to host a database somewhere that everyone who\n",
    "needs access can reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many cloud providers offer database solutions with easy-to-use\n",
    "interfaces, allowing us (for a cost!) to worry less about exactly how\n",
    "the DBMS is working and focus, instead, on the data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which Database to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "Which type of database you choose should be driven by your data and how\n",
    "you plan to use it. You may find that your data can be expressed in more\n",
    "than one of the forms above or as a table. You then need to weigh up\n",
    "different factors to decide which form and which database, if any, to\n",
    "use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some factors you may consider (unordered!):\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Ease of use\n",
    "-   Cost\n",
    "-   Footprint on disk\n",
    "-   Footprint in memory\n",
    "-   Retrieval/update speed\n",

    "## Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)\n",
    "\n",
    "Application programming interfaces (APIs) are services that allow you to\n",
    "programmatically request information, including datasets, from a remote\n",

    "available to access their data, including\n",
    "[GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api),\n",
    "[Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api) and the\n",
    "[Office for National Statistics](https://developer.ons.gov.uk/), for\n",
    "example. Advantages of APIs include:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   It’s possible to make queries to request a tailored subset of a\n",
    "    dataset, so you only get what you’re interested in.\n",
    "-   It’s straightforward to automate making many similar queries (i.e.,\n",
    "    to request many different datasets) with different parameters.\n",
    "-   If a dataset is updating regularly (maybe you want to know the\n",
    "    current weather at a location, for example) they provide a robust\n",
    "    way to get the latest status of what you’re interested in.\n",
    "-   They usually should provide a reproducible way for others to\n",
    "    download the same data you’re using.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most APIs follow the REST style, which we briefly introduce here, but\n",
    "you may also come across GraphQL APIs. [This\n",
    "blog](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/01/understanding-using-rest-api/)\n",
    "has an overview of both types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datamuse API\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, we’ll try the Datamuse API, which can be used to find\n",
    "relationships between words and terms (similar words, words that rhyme\n",
    "and so on). You can find documentation for it here:\n",
    "https://www.datamuse.com/api/\n",
    "\n",
    "An API query has four main components: a base URL, an endpoint,\n",
    "parameters, and headers:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Base URL:** The address of the server hosting the data we want to\n",
    "access - all our API queries will start with this. For the Datamuse API\n",
    "it’s: `https://api.datamuse.com`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Endpoint:** Each API might have multiple types of data we can query,\n",
    "known as different \"endpoints\". The path to the endpoint is added to the\n",
    "base URL. The Datamuse API has two endpoints:`/words` for searching for\n",
    "relationships (of different types) between words, and `/sug`, which can\n",
    "be used for auto-completion/spelling correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters:** Define what data subset we’re interested in and are\n",
    "provided in the format `name=value`. These are added to the query after\n",
    "a `?` following the endpoint. To specify multiple parameters, separate\n",
    "each parameter name and value pair with an `&`. The available parameters\n",
    "should be listed in the API’s documentation\n",
    "([here](https://www.datamuse.com/api/) for Datamuse).\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter string `?rel_jjb=dog&max=5` defines two parameters and\n",
    "values:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `rel_jjb=dog`: Find adjectives commonly used to describe the\n",
    "noun \"dog\".\n",
    "- `max=5`: Return 5 results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Headers:** Provide additional context/metadata about your request, the\n",
    "most common being authentication information. Authentication may be used\n",
    "to only give you access to resources you have permission to see, limit\n",
    "the number of requests you can make within a certain amount of time, or\n",
    "for billing purposes (if the API isn’t free).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Datamuse API doesn’t require authentication, so we don’t need to add\n",
    "any headers here. If the API you’re using requires it they should\n",
    "provide documentation that describes what you need to do - [here is an\n",
    "example from\n",
    "GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#authentication),\n",
    "and [here is how to add headers in the Python requests\n",
    "library](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#custom-headers).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Full query:** Adding together all the components we have the full API\n",
    "query:\n",
    "\n",
    "- https://api.datamuse.com/words?rel_jjb=dog&max=5\n",
    "\n",
    "You can open this in a web browser and should see something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "[\n",
    "    {\"word\": \"little\", \"score\": 1001},\n",
    "    {\"word\": \"old\", \"score\": 1000},\n",

    "\n",
    "We get the top 5 words describing \"dog\" and a score that indicates how\n",
    "strong the association is.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common format for data returned by an API is JSON (JavaScript\n",
    "Object Notation) from the JavaScript language, which is commonly used in\n",
    "web development. JSONs have a similar structure to Python dictionaries\n",

If you're making many queries you may need to limit their rate in your script to avoid breaching the usage rules of the API - a quick way to do that would be to use the [time.sleep](https://realpython.com/python-sleep/#adding-a-python-sleep-call-with-timesleep) function in Python.\n",
