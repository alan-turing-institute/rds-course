# Overview

TODO: write overview for module 2


inline TODOs:
- `grep "TODO" coursebook/modules/m2/* --exclude=hands-on.ipynb`

outstanding sections:
- FeatureEngineering 
- CategoricalData (part complete)

outstanding subsections:
- sampling bias (not a section in own right?)
    - e.g. collection skewed towards/against single demographic
- badly designed capture/missed variables (e.g. missing q in survey, leading q)


outstanding for hands on:
- Extra taught to cover
    - `DataFrame.groupby`
    - `Series.str.replace`
- Hands On
    - handover format?
    - fix error reporting in renaming (doesn't handle key error)
    - missing data - e.g. more for some countries than others?
    
    
overlaps?:
- Feature Engineering: m3/4?
- Missing Data: m3

Extra thoughts to check we cover:
- raw data is not raw
