The code for this course should run with Python 3.7 or above. We don't cover it here to speedup setup, but if you need to use multiple versions of Python on your system we recommend [Pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html#)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["### Creating a Virtual Environment with `Poetry`\n","\n","The Python ecosystem has many different ways of managing packaging and installing dependencies ([this page](https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#pipenv) lists somem).
