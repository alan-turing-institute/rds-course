    "The Python ecosystem has many different ways of managing packaging and installing dependencies ([this page](https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#pipenv) lists somem). The most well-known is `pip` with dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we use the tool [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), which can help manage [multiple environments](https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-environments/), in particular [switching between environments ](https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-environments/#switching-between-environments).\n",
    "\n",
    "Dependencies are listed in `pyproject.toml` and have versions fixed in `poetry.lock`. `Poetry` will pick these files up and install the required packages in a predictable manner, and into a virtual environment isolated from other projects on your system.\n",

    "   - If `python --version` is less than 3.7 (e.g., 2.7), but `python3 --version` gives 3.7 or above:\n",
    "      - Run `poetry env use python3`\n",
    "   - If you have a Python 3.7+ environment available somewhere else:\n",
    "      -  Run `poetry env use /full/path/to/python`\n",
    "   - If you don't have Python 3.7+ installed or don't know where to find it:\n",
    "      - Refer back to the instructions in the prerequisites and/or ask for help.\n",

Save this script as `get-poetry.py` and then run `python get-poetry.py` to install Poetry.\n",
