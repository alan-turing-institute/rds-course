    "## What is Open Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the definition from [The Turing\n",
    "Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/open/open-data.html):\n",
    "\n",
    "> Open data is freely available on the internet. Any user is permitted\n",
    "to download, copy, analyse, re-process, and re-use it for any other\n",
    "purpose with minimal financial, legal, and technical barriers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of using an open dataset include (but are not limited to):\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Access to the data is free and usually fast (without requiring a\n",
    "    registration/approval process).\n",
    "-   Other researchers may have used the same dataset and published\n",
    "    guidelines, code and other details about the dataset that are also\n",
    "    in the public domain. So we can benefit and draw inspiration from\n",

    "## Sources of Open Data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many sources of data online, below are a few ideas for places\n",
    "to look.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tailored for Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide datasets with data science applications in mind, so are more\n",
    "likely to be in easy-to-use formats and may have already been\n",
    "pre-processed in some way. Many popular machine learning libraries like\n",
    "PyTorch also have datasets built in. These are excellent sources for\n",
    "finding datasets to learn, test and benchmark algorithms or other\n",

    "\n",
    "### Countries/Governments\n",
    "\n",
    "Many governments commit to publishing data in the open for public\n",
    "interest and transparency. The datasets might be less “data science\n",
    "ready”, but they cover a broad range of topics.\n",

    "### Organisations\n",
    "\n",
    "Large humanitarian organisations often make data available, such as:\n",

    "-   [World Bank](https://microdata.worldbank.org/index.php/home)\n",
    "-   [World Health Organisation](https://www.who.int/data/collections)\n",
    "-   [International Monetary Fund](https://www.imf.org/en/Data)\n",
    "\n",
    "### General\n",
    "\n",
    "General tools and repositories that contain data across many different\n",
    "domains:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)\n",
    "-   GitHub: Although large datasets can’t be stored on GitHub there are\n",
    "    many smaller datasets to be found in GitHub repositories. There are\n",
    "    also community-maintained lists of interesting datasets, e.g.,\n",
    "    [awesome-public-datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets).\n",
    "-   [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/): Combined repository for open data,\n",

    "## When Open Data Isn’t Available\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can start your project with an open dataset that’s always\n",
    "preferable. Even if the perfect dataset is not openly available it may\n",
    "be worth first prototyping with related data that is open. For example,\n",
    "it may be that an older version of the data you’re interested in has\n",
    "been made public. You can continue to explore options for getting the\n",
    "ideal data in parallel, but gaining data access is frequently an\n",
    "expensive or time-consuming process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two common reasons open data may not be available or appropriate are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The data is commercially sensitive or valuable.\n",
    "2. The data presents a privacy or security risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access to detailed healthcare records, for example, is often heavily\n",
    "restricted even if personal identifiers have been removed due to the\n",
    "risk of re-identification. In August 2016 the Australian government\n",
    "openly published a de-identified medical billing dataset, but one month\n",
    "later [researchers at the University of\n",
    "Melbourne](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05627.pdf) demonstrated it was\n",
    "possible to re-identify individuals and the data was taken offline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Options for finding a non-open dataset include:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ask!\n",
    "\n",
    "Although open data may not be available for your project, a\n",
    "collaborator, someone else at your institute, company, or the wider\n",
    "community could have something relevant. However, even if they’re\n",
    "willing to share it, you must check what the conditions are for access\n",
    "and usage of the data and get advice where necessary. Always err on the\n",
    "side of caution, especially if any of the data relates to living\n",
    "individuals. Alternatively, you may find someone else that’s interested\n",
    "in the same data, and you could join forces (or budgets) to get it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Paywalled/Restricted Access\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting access to a dataset that’s behind closed doors is likely to\n",
    "involve a registration or application process and may include a fee.\n",
    "Bear in mind that data can be *expensive*, and could easily cost\n",
    "thousands of pounds. If the application is approved, the resulting\n",
    "contract/ research agreement may specify precisely which data you can\n",
    "have access to (down to the level of individual fields), who will have\n",
    "access, the duration of access, and exactly what you’re allowed to do\n",
    "with it. As an example, [this\n",
    "website](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/enable-your-research) describes the\n",
    "process for accessing the UK Biobank, a large biomedical database for\n",
    "health research.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Your Own Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately the data you need might not be available anywhere, in which\n",
    "case the only option could be to collect it yourself. Designing datasets\n",
    "is not the focus of this course, but if you’re making your own remember\n",
    "you’ll be the one analysing it! Investing time in thinking about how\n",
    "your data will be structured and how you’ll deal with missing values and\n",
    "the many other issues common in datasets will save a lot of time later.\n",
    "You must also carefully consider whether it is ethical to collect the\n",
    "data and have approval from your organisation to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assessing Dataset Quality and Suitability\n",
    "\n",
    "In Module 1 ([Section 1.2](../m1/1.2-DataScienceProjectLifecycle),\n",
    "question 3 for scoping projects) we gave these overarching questions for\n",
    "evaluating a dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does the dataset contain what’s needed to solve the research question\n",
    "  available?\n",
    "- Can I legally and ethically use the data?\n",
    "- Is the data easily accessible? - Is the dataset well-understood and\n",
    "  tested?\n",
    "- Is data quality and quantity appropriate?\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful concept here is [data readiness\n",
    "levels](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.02245.pdf):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Band C:Accessibility**\n",
    "   - C4: You believe the data may exist, but haven’t seen/verified that\n",
    "     it does.\n",
    "   - C1: The data is ready to be loaded into an analysis: You have access,\n",
    "     it’s in an appropriate format, and you have (both ethical and legal)\n",
    "     permission to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Band B: Faihfulness & Representation**\n",
    "   - B1: The data has been used in an exploratory analysis, and you have\n",
    "     verified the contents match what you expected. You understand any\n",
    "     limitations (e.g. how missing values were treated).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Band A: Data in Context**\n",
    "   - A1: The data has been prepared and is suitable to answer a\n",
    "     *specific* research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module we cover many of the steps needed to take data from Band\n",
    "C to Band B: we start with data we know exists but don’t know how to\n",
    "analyse, and end with beginning an exploratory analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For evaluating all of these, **data documentation** is essential. See\n",
    "[The Turing\n",
    "Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-metadata.html)\n",
    "and this [Radboud University\n",
    "article](https://www.ru.nl/rdm/processing-data/documenting-data/) for a\n",
    "details of what good documentation should contain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sharing Data\n",
    "\n",
    "If your project is working with, or has generated, a dataset consider\n",
    "whether you can publish it with an open license. The community can then\n",
    "benefit from all the advantages of open data we’ve talked about! It’s\n",
    "also becoming more common for funders and journals to *require* code and\n",
    "data to be published with papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won’t discuss this here but the [Sharing and Archiving\n",
    "Data](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-sharing.html)\n",
    "chapter in the Turing Way is a great place to start."
