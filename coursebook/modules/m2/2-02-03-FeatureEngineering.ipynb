    "## Feature Selection and Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "It's beyond the scope of what we cover here, but another important topic is the \"curse of dimensionality\", or what to do when we have many features (columns) relative to the number of samples (rows) in the dataset. [This blog post](http://blog.dominodatalab.com/the-curse-of-dimensionality) summarises how this can cause problems in some models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking there are three techniques that can be used when this is a problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature selection:** Only include a subset of the available features in the model, keeping those that are the strongest predictors for the target variable. Scikit-learn has some algorithms for feature selection available, see [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html).\n",
    "- **Dimensionality reduction:** Condense the original features into a smaller number of new features (each one being a function/combination of the original features) that maintain important relationships in the data. The most well-known technique here is [Principal Component Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis), which also has a [scikit-learn implementation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/decomposition.html#pca).\n",
    "- **Regularisation:** Modifies the \"cost function\" of a model to penalise complexity (i.e. preferring solutions that give a large weighting to a smaller number of features). [See this blog post](https://programmathically.com/regularization-in-machine-learning/) for more details.  "

    "## Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "We've shown how to quickly perform various feature engineering techniques in Pandas, but it's important to consider how to integrate these into a modelling or analysis pipeline. In particular, any transformations you use whilst training a model should be saved so they can later be re-used to test the model on new data. There are other libraries and frameworks which can help you do this more efficiently, such as `scikit-learn` (see the [Dataset transformations  section](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/data_transforms.html) of the user guide)."
