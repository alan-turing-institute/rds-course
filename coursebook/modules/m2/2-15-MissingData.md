# 2.15 Missing Data (TODO)

m3.5?

> Module 2: Missigness, the analysis from Christina shows a lot of missing variables in Wave 2, so we decided to stick to Wave 3 only. But it could be a good hand-on exercise for the students to motivate this. Furthermore, in Wave 3 there is variables with a large percentage of missing data that we end up dropping (for variables with less data missing weâ€™ll use imputation). It could be good that this is understood, and the students also investigate if there are groups (countries, sectors of populations) where there is more data missing than others, and what could be the consequences of any imputation we might do.

- How are they represented/finding them?

    - imputation
    - delete/ignore
