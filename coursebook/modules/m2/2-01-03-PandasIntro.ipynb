    "# 2.1.3 Pandas intro\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pandas library is a core part of the Python data science ecosystem.\n",
    "It provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas has some great resources for getting started, including guides\n",
    "tailored to those familiar with other software for manipulating data:\n",
    "https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/index.html#getting-started\n",
    ".\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we’ll stick just to what we need for this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "`{code-cell} ipython3 import pandas as pd`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas has two main **labelled** data structures: - Series\n",
    "\n",
    "`{code-cell} ipython3 s = pd.Series([0.3, 4, 1, None, 9]) print(s)`\n",
    "\n",
    "-   DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "`{code-cell} ipython3 import numpy as np df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(10,2), index=np.arange(3, 13), columns=[\"random_A\", \"random_B\"]) df`\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have data in these Pandas structures, we can perform some useful\n",
    "operations such as: - `info()` - (`DataFrame` only) - prints a concise\n",
    "summary of a `DataFrame` - `value_counts()` - returns a `Series`\n",
    "containing counts of unique values in the structure\n",
    "\n",
    "`{code-cell} ipython3 s = pd.Series(np.random.randint(0,2,10)) print(s) print() # blank line print(\"value counts:\") print(s.value_counts())`\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll see more on how to use these structures, and other Pandas\n",
    "capabilities, later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we’re just covering some basics here. For a complete guide to\n",
    "indexing in Pandas see\n",
    "[here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas allows us to use the same basic `[]` indexing and `.` attribute\n",
    "operators that we’re used to with Python and NumPy. However, Pandas also\n",
    "provides the (often preferred) `.loc` labelled indexing method and the\n",
    "`.iloc` position indexing methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `[]` Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "For basic `[]` indexing, we can select columns from a DataFrame and\n",
    "items from a Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\`\\`\\`{code-cell} ipython3 \\# reusing our DataFrame and Series from\n",
    "earlier\n",
    "\n",
    "# Basic indexing using `[]` on DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "# select a single column\n",
    "\n",
    "print(“single column from DataFrame, gives us a Series:”)\n",
    "display(df\\[“random_A”\\])\n",
    "\n",
    "# select two columns\n",
    "\n",
    "print(“two columns from DataFrame, gives us a DataFrame:”)\n",
    "display(df\\[\\[“random_A”, “random_B”\\]\\])\n",
    "\n",
    "# and for a Series\n",
    "\n",
    "# select single item\n",
    "\n",
    "print(“single item from Series, gives us an item (of type numpy.int64,\n",
    "in this case):”) display(s\\[2\\])\n",
    "\n",
    "# select two items\n",
    "\n",
    "print(“two items from Series, gives us a Series:”) display(s\\[\\[2,4\\]\\])\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note that we can't do:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```{code-cell} ipython3\n",
    "    :tags: [\"raises-exception\"]\n",
    "    df[5]\n",
    "\n",
    "as this tries to access a row, not a column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attribute Access\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can access a column from a DataFrame and an item from a\n",
    "Series using as an attribute. However, we can’t do this when the label\n",
    "is not a valid identifier. We can’t do `s.2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`{code-cell} ipython3 :tags: [\"raises-exception\"] # Using attribute access display(df.random_A)`\n",
    "\n",
    "`{code-cell} ipython3 :tags: [\"raises-exception\"] # and for a Series, this will break display(s.2)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### `.loc`\n",
    "\n",
    "`.loc` provides label-based indexing. `.loc` can also be used for\n",
    "slicing and we can even provide a `callable` as its input! However, here\n",
    "we’ll just show single item access.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\`\\`\\`{code-cell} ipython3 \\# for DataFrame display(df.loc\\[5\\])\n",
    "\n",
    "# and for a Series\n",
    "\n",
    "display(s.loc\\[2\\])\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    ### `.iloc`\n",
    "\n",
    "    `.iloc` provides integer-based indexing. This closely resembles Python and NumPy slicing. Again, we'll just show single item access.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```{code-cell} ipython3\n",
    "    # for DataFrame\n",
    "    display(df.iloc[5])\n",
    "\n",
    "    # and for a Series\n",
    "    display(s.iloc[2])"
