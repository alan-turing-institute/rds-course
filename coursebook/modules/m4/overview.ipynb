One of the\n","most powerful methods of learning from data is **statistical\n","modelling**.\n","\n","We demystify the key concepts involved through applying simple models (linear and logistic regression). The intended take-homes can be applied to any modelling problem.\n","\n","The module is structured as follows:\n","\n","-   **The what and why of statistical modelling**. We begin by defining\n","    what modelling is and motivating the power of modelling.\n","-   **Fitting models**. Here we go through the components of a model,\n","    including describing how to fit one to data.\n","-   **Building a simple model**. We then carefully build a model based\n","    on the understanding of our data, taking care to understand the\n","    model.\n","-   **Evaluation a model**. It is not enough to have a model that is\n","    fitted to your data. The model has to be useful. The final section\n","    will cover how to evaluate your model and iteratively improve upon\n","    your model.\n","\n","**References:**\n","\n","We will include more specific references as we move through the module.\n","But useful accessible introductions to modelling that has inspired much\n","of this module’s content are Poldrack’s [Statistical Thinking for the\n","21st\n","Century](https://web.stanford.edu/group/poldracklab/statsthinking21/index.html),\n","Holmes and Huber’s [Modern Statistics for Modern\n","Biology](https://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/Chap-Models.html),\n","as well as the introductory sections of Richard McElreath’s wonderfully\n","readable [Statistical\n","Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) and Bishop’s\n","classic [Machine Learning for Pattern\n","Recognition](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf)\n","textbook."]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3.10.4 64-bit","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.10.6"},"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"aee8b7b246df8f9039afb4144a1f6fd8d2ca17a180786b69acc140d282b71a49"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
