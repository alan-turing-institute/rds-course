- [name=Camila] *What I think we should write here*:
    - Mention how we all know how to make plots, and probably have done thousands on our professional lifetimes, however this is not necesarily an easy job and there are plenty of examples of figures that have gone wrong in different ways, for example:

<!-- â€¦(Note to Callum: I managed to group these in 4 groups: misleading information, lack of uncertainty, overcomplicated figures and problems with anotations. Maybe we can come up with better names for the groups).-->

#### **Misleading information**


- Axes does not start at zero and exaggerates the effect (from [here](https://www.callingbullshit.org/tools/tools_misleading_axes.html)):

#### Figures that fail to represent uncertainty

#### **Over complicated figures**:

- Over complicated figure (a bar chart would have been enough):
