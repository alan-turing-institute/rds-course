# 3.1 Figures gone wrong

Every data scientist will create hundreds of figures in their professional lifetime. Creating plots is easy, complicated figures can be achieved in a single line of code.

Creating **good** plots is hard.

Here we've collated examples of figures that do a poor job of communicating the data. As we go through these examples we will have a brief discussion about each figure (we will use a hackmd to collaborate). Once you've had a chance to look at an example you can expand our notes below each example (you can find many more examples at @GraphCrimes on twitter).

## Example 1

<font size="1">[Source](https://www.callingbullshit.org/tools/tools_misleading_axes.html)</font>

<details>
    <summary>Example 1 notes</summary>
This figure is a classic example of misleading information. The axes does not start at zero so the effect is visually exaggerated, and we are not given the uncertainty around these averages. The reader is therefore unable to interpret the practical significance of any differences between groups.

## Example 2

<details>
    <summary>Example 2 notes</summary>
Here data has been selectively plotted to exaggerate an idea. There are a number of issues with this plot:

- We only have two data points for each trend, and it is practically impossible that the trend would be a perfect straight line. Rather, any trend would fluctuate year on year, this proposed difference between 2008 and 2013 may be within the bounds of an noisy signal.
-   If you look at the numbers there are clearly two axes at play, or at least no attempt has been made to represent the magnitude of the change realistically.
- Plotting these two data sources together here suggests there is a relationship between them (i.e. that the company _Planned Parenthood_ has redistributed resources from cancer screening to abortions). It is an ethical responsibility for any figure creator to ensure that your figure is not implying a conclusion that isn't supported by your data.

To illustrate how misleading this original figure is, here is an example of the same data visualised in a more responsible manner.

## Example 3

<details>
    <summary>Example 3 notes</summary>
Example 3 is very confusing because the scale of the x-axis is altered mid-plot. Even after reading the caption it is very difficult to get a feel for the data because the grid-lines give a powerful signal of uniformity. 
</details>

## Example 4

<details>
    <summary>Example 4 notes</summary>
The phenomenon that this xkcd comic is getting at is Normalisation. Normalisation is where you alter a scale to be between zero and one (usually). Failure to normalise is when different measurements that themselves have different scales are plotted on the same scale. The comic shows the classic failure to normalise measurements by population. A variable that was consistently 10% of the population would appear to vary across the map.

## Example 5

<details>
    <summary>Example 5 notes</summary>
Both these plots are examples of where using only averages means that the figure does not communicate all of the information, such as the spread of the distribution. The kernel density estimates (more on those in Section 3.3) below show a slice of one particular year, offering complementary information that allows us to interpret the averages in context.

## Example 6

<font size="1">[Source](https://badvisualisations.tumblr.com/post/184827953341/this-is-not-all-you-need-to-click-through-to-this)</font>
<details>
    <summary>Example 6 notes</summary>
This figure does not appear to have been created to clearly communicate data. There is far too much information on this figure to be able to intuitively grasp the message. A reader should be able to understand a figure quickly.
</details>

## Example 7
![](https://i.imgur.com/n72HXxI.jpg)
<font size="1">[Source](https://twitter.com/10DowningStreet/status/1322614557181960195)</font>
<details>
    <summary>Example 7 notes</summary>
This figure was presented quickly in a UK Government Covid briefing. In such a situation rapid and clear comprehension of figures is paramount. Here this figure is guilty of overplotting, which is attempting to squeeze too much information into one figure, ultimately rendering it difficult to comprehend.
</details>

## Example 8

<font size="1">[Source](https://twitter.com/Rodpac/status/1250764503861600256?s=20)</font>
<details>
    <summary>Example 8 notes</summary>
Although you can see the relative pattern of the two signals, there is no y-axis! One can therefore not assess the magnitude of the difference.
</details>

## Example 9
![](https://i.imgur.com/q9r9GpE.png)
<font size="1">[Source](https://www.visualisingdata.com/)</font>
<details>
    <summary>Example 9 notes</summary>
Though this pie chart represents the data well there are confusing aesthetic choices. We have redundant information: there is really no need for the legend since all the slices of the pie chart are labelled anyway.
</details>


## Example 10
![](https://i.imgur.com/4OUGwbR.png)
<font size="1">[Source](https://badvisualisations.tumblr.com/post/184827953341/this-is-not-all-you-need-to-click-through-to-this)</font>
<details>
    <summary>Example 10 notes</summary>
Similarly to Example 10, the aesthetics of this graph detract from communicating the data. The y axis could be represented on a scale of millions (i.e. from 0 to $500), and there is no need to note all the data points. If one wants to write out the data, use a table!

The hackmd link we were using to share comments will stay live for the duration of the course. If you have came across any figures that you think could be instructive to the group (good or bad), please share! (include a source if possible).

Feel free to also share your own figures. Figure creation is iterative and improved by critique from others.
