In this module we aim to provide useful tips that can improve the way you use visualisation to effectively and accurately comunicate insights from data.

- [name=Camila] *What I think we should write here*:
    -  Mention importance of data viz as tool for storytelling and outreach, specially how this has become fundamental in the context of the pandemic. 

This module is structured as follows: first we will discuss the basics of data visualisation (rules of the game), from here we will look at a variety of graphs and discuss which kind of graphs are better for different type of scenarios. Then we will follow with a discussion of how to tell a story with data visualisation and how to include context and ethical considerations in conceiving the story to tell. Finnaly we will talk about using data visualisation to better understand your own data.
