# Overview

Great figures bring data to life. They can make your communication clearer and more compelling, and often are the most viewed and shared part of any data story. 

However, bad figures can mislead and confuse. At worst, they tell a story that simply does not exist.

In this module we provide useful tips that can help you tell good figures from bad ones. We will give you a foundation to improve the way you use visualisation to effectively and accurately comunicate insights from data.

This module is structured as follows: 
- **Figures Gone Wrong**. We start by looking to the real-world for examples of bad figures to show how easy it is to (knowingly or unknowingly) make mistakes.
- **Rules of the data visualisation game**. A whip-round of the basics of data visualisation (rules of the game).
- **Directory of Visualisations**. We will look at how the fundamentals of visualisation are commonly adapted for different scenarios and data types.
- **Figures are Stories**. Summarised the previous sections, we touch on how to ensure your figure is delivering the appropriate message.
- **Visualisation for Data Exploration**. Finally, we discuss how data scientists routinely use figures to get to know datasets.


**References**:

We are professional research data scientists who have spent some time plotting, but we are not experts in data visualisation.  Fortunately, there are plenty of experts out there who offer excellent pedagogical material. This course is mostly based on these resources, with a sprinkling of hard-won lessons of our own. 

The resources that has influenced this chapter the most is the [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/) book by Claus O. Wilke. We also draw frequently from Andy Kirk's [visualising data site](https://www.visualisingdata.com/), as well as numerous others that we reference as we go.
