## For Students

The most recent online version of the course can be found [here](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/rds-course/index.html). The course materials are hosted in `coursebook/`.

## For Developers

Learn how to contribute to the course with the [developer instructions](coursebook/README.md).

### Workflow

- We will use the long-running branch `develop` to host the most up-to-date version of the course. Developers should branch off `develop` for individual module development with a long-running branch per module (e.g. `module_1`). Request review from the developer team when merging into `develop`. The [course pages](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/rds-course/index.html) will be rebuilt whenever someone pushes to `develop`.
- We only merge into `main` once content has been reviewed by persons external to the course development team.
