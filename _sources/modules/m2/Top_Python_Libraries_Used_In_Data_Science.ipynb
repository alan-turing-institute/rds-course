Here there is no need to focus on applying from scratch or learning new algorithms, all you need to know is learn how to approach the data and solve the problem. One of the key things that you need to know is using appropriate libraries to solve a data science problem. This article is all about providing the context to the important libraries used in Data Science. Before dwelling into the topic I would like to introduce the 5 primitive steps involved in solving a data science problem. Now I have sat down and designed these steps from scratch, so there is no right or wrong answer, the correct answer depends on how you approach the data."

Many of the dataset available on the internet is based on a problem so here your problem-solving skills are very important. Also, there is no one algorithm that fits the best for your solution, you gotta think whether your data falls under regression, classification, clustering or dimension reduction all there are different categories of algorithms.
