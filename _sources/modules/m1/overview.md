# Overview

In this first module we will be covering:

1. An introduction to Research Data Science: What data science and research data science are, overview of the variety of cultures within them and the role of a research data scientist.
2. The lifecycle of a Research Data Science project and an intro to scoping RDS projects
3. Equality, Diversity and Inclusion considerations for data scientists
4. A few important concepts when working on collaborative reproducible projects
5 Hands-on session: Scope a research data science project using a real-world individual-level dataset, including discussion of research question and EDI issues and setting up a collaborative GitHub repo.

**Disclaimer and references**:

We are professional research data scientists who work collaboratively with researchers and other stakeholders daily. We have been involved in scoping a number of projects with academic and industries partners and discussing issues of research ethics in our work. Parts of this chapter have been strongly influenced by the book [Data Feminism](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/).
