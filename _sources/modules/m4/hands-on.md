# Module 4: hands-on session

## Description
In this hands-on session participants are divided in groups of 4 o 5 participants and paired with a helper. Each group should choose one of the proposed tasks (or propose a new one if keen!) and work together on it. At the end of the session the students will present their work to the class.

The timeline for this session is the following:

- Phase 1: Presentation of tasks and goals of the hands-on session (15 minutes)
- Phase 2: Groups are formed and students choose task to develop (15 minutes)
- Phase 3: Work on the tasks (2.5 hours + with two 15 m break)
- Phase 4: Students presenting their findings (30 minutes)
- Phase 5: Final discussion (30 minutes)

Students are encouraged to use code developed in the hands-on session for module 3 and/or the data exploration notebook in Sections 4.3 and 4.4. 
They can use data from the UK or choose another country. Presentations should last around 5 minutes.

## Proposed tasks

1. **Improving the models**: We invited you to try to improve/modify the models discussed in _Section 4.4_, in one of the following ways

    - In the hand-on session of Module 3 we proposed to investigate imputation methods to deal with missing data. Build and compare
    models using the imputed dataset. 
        
    - Adding new variables and/or [interactions variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_(statistics))  to the model. 
    
    - Dealing with the imbalance in the dataset (for some ideas see [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-deal-with-imbalanced-data-34ab7db9b100)).  
    
    - Any other model modification you might want to try.

    
2. **Comparative analysis with another country**: Up to now we have only looked at the UK, but what happens in other countries?
How good is the performance if you use a model trained with UK data in another country? How different is the model (coefficients, performance, etc) trained with data from
   another country (e.g Poland vs the model of the UK shown in _Section 4.4_). Can you conclude that the same factors have different
   impact between the countries? Feel free to compare between any country you'd like.
   
    
We expect you to compare and discuss in detail what you have learned from these new models and think what would be the answer
to the research question. 

## Final discussion session

Group discussion with the following points. We don't have "right answers" for this discussion. 

1. If the research question asks for an overall assessment of all Europe. How do we appropriately combine the models?
   
2. Is there a better way of modeling dataset given the research question?
   
3. After everything you've done in all the hands on sessions, what would be your answer to
the research question? What else has to be done?
